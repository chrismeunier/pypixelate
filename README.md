# pypixelate
Pixelate given images using OpenCV Python

## What is it ?
An extremely simple GUI made with tkinter where you can select an image and apply a pixelated effect to it.

It's basically a fancy wrapper around OpenCV `resize` function.

## How to use it ?
Run the `pixelate_app.py` script, that's it.
You will need `opencv-python` and `pillow` installed in your Python environment, it should work with any vaguely recent Python 3 installation.

You can use the app to apply the current pixelation size setting to all images inside a given folder.
